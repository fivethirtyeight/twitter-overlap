# 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Twitter followers

This data was used in the FiveThirtyEight story [Which 2020 Candidates Have The Most In Common … On Twitter?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-2020-candidates-have-the-most-in-common-on-twitter/). This directory contains data on the nearly 20 million Twitter users who follow 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.

The candidates included here are those who were [considered “major”](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-how-were-defining-a-major-presidential-candidate/) by FiveThirtyEight in early May, and the accounts used are those candidates’ primary accounts, according to a [C-SPAN Twitter list](https://twitter.com/cspan/lists/presidential-candidates/members). For each of those candidates, we collected the user IDs of all of their followers. This collection was performed from May 8 to May 15, with the exception of the followers of John Hickenlooper, which were re-scraped on June 6 to correct a problem caused by a bug.

Each candidate’s text file (Bernie Sanders's has been split due to space constraints) contains a list of anonymized follower IDs. In total, the 20 text files here include 19,518,088 unique followers.
